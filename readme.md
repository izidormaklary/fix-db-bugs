## The Mission


My coach wrote [a small script](resources/index.php) that manages users and their favorite sports.

However, he drank a bit too much of his favorite drink and the script is littered with bugs.

The coach has added some comments where these bugs are, but gave up on fixing them.

I have to fixed them all :confused:
